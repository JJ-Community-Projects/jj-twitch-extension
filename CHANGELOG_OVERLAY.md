The overlay consists of 4 buttons.
These are visible when the user hovers over the stream.
When clicked they will show a new panel with more information.
The buttons are:
- The Jingle Jam, a short description of the Jingle Jam event with links to their socials
- The Charities, a list of the charities that the Jingle Jam is supporting with links to their websites and tiltify.
- The Community Fundraisers, a list of the community fundraisers with links to their Twitch pages.
- About, a short description of the overlay with a link to the source code.

The Overlay also allows streamers to define commands which their mods can use to show a banner with information about a charity.
This feature can be turned off by the streamer and by each user.
