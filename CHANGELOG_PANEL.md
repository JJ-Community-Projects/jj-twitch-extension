2.0.0
- Last year was supposed to be 1.0.0, but I set the wrong version number...
- Updated Backend endpoints
- Add new topbar with separate About and donate buttons
- Simplify schedule stream dialog.

About:
The panel consists of 3 tabs.
The Tabs order and visibility can be configured by the streamer.
The tabs are:
- Yogs Schedule, which shows the current JJ schedule for the Yogscast Twitch channel.
- Charities, which shows the current charity that the Jingle Jam is supporting.
- Community, which shows a list of JJ community fundraisers.

Users can click on streams to get more information 
and charities to visit their websites.
Users can also click on community fundraisers to visit their Twitch pages.

For demo purposes, so of the data is from last year.
